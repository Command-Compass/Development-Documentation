#### Agenda:

3. Features and dynamic elements of the new page.

#### Decisions Made:

1. **Change in Functionality of "Get Started" Button:**
   - The "Get Started" button on the homepage will no longer trigger a pop-up.
   - Instead, clicking the button will now redirect users to a new "Get Started" page.

2. **Layout of the New "Get Started" Page:**
   - The new page will present two options on the left-hand side, similar to the options that were previously shown in the pop-up.
   - These options will guide users to different experiences based on their selection.

3. **Features of the New "Get Started" Page:**
   - The page will include a dynamic picture feature that changes based on the option selected by the user, similar to the functionality seen on HackerRank’s "Get Started" page.
   - This dynamic visual will enhance user engagement and provide a preview of the respective experience.

#### Action Items:
- **Design Team:** Develop the new layout for the "Get Started" page with the two options on the left-hand side.
- **Development Team:** Implement the redirect functionality for the "Get Started" button on the homepage to the new page.
- **UI/UX Team:** Create and integrate the dynamic picture feature that changes according to the selected option.
- **QA Team:** Test the new page and button functionality to ensure a seamless user experience.

#### Next Steps:
